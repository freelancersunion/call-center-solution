CALL CENTER DISASTER RECOVERY SOLUTION

======================================

The call center disaster recovery solution provides ccxml portal, MQ producer/consumer, and webservices to manage call handling and agent selection. The ccxml portal can be loaded into an existing phone tree by creating an application in Voxeo's cloud, and issuing a <createcall> to the assigned number. A demo of the application can be see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMN04Gucnck.

DEPENDENCIES
	
(Python)
Django == 1.1.1

simplejson
amqplib
logging
urllib
urllib2

(Services)
postgres DB with dbname=cc_ivr
Rabbit MQ

INSTALL

The python libs can be installed using setuptools: python setup.py install . This will install django and ampqlib for Rabbit MQ. This currently creates dist/ and egg/ folders which aren't needed and can be removed.

Rabbit MQ can be installed following the instructions here:  http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html.

To create the ccxml portal, upload the files in cc_vector_ccxml/ to Voxeo's cloud and create an application that points to 'call_center_ivr.ccxml'. The number assigned from Voxeo can be used to call the application.

Run the sql_scripts found in cc_vector_webservices/services/. This will create the agents and call_history tables.



SETUP

To use this solution, start the django server. Update PHONO_API_KEY in django settings.py.
Update 'WEBSERVICE_URL' in ccxml to point to above django server.

Update the Rabbit MQ configs found in cc_vector_manager/config.py.
Start consumer by running call_center_vector_consumer.py script.
